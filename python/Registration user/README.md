### We have a csv file of names and grades of students in a class, It reads the csv file and put its information in three separate dictionaries

* A dictionary contains the names and grades of all students
* The dictionary contains the names and grades of all students whose grades are between 17 and 20
* The dictionary contains the names and grades of all students whose grades are between 0 and 10
* We defined the lookup function to get the name of the student and its score Mena Seb returned the message
